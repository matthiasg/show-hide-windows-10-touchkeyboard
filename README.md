# show-hide-windows-10-touchkeyboard

We needed two executables to force showing and hiding the touch keyboard on Windows 10 devices (1803+ but previous should work too) triggered from Electron.

Sadly there does not seem to be a simple and documented API to perform that. Electrons Chromium should trigger it automatically, but sadly there are a number of scenarios when it doesn't do that correctly or reliably and some of the fixes that came in recently are not available in Electron yet.

So based on an undocumented API (toggle) and some added heuristics (to check whether the keyboard is open) I wrote this code. Some of the code is taken/rewritten from a number of posts around the web and my sincere thanks go out to the people in the forums such as https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47187216/determine-if-windows-10-touch-keyboard-is-visible-or-hidden

If it helps someone great, use it, comments are welcome but the code written here is not best-practice and I will not fix bugs that I am not affected by.

Cheers.

PS:

This code works best when `DisableNewKeyboardExperience` under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\TabletTip\1.7` is set to `1` (Thanks to https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/profile/technutta?type=forum&referrer=https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsdesktop/en-US/aba8e07c-7d44-42a9-a9eb-d7387a201899/on-screen-keyboard-not-working-in-custom-shell-windows-10-pro-1709-and-1803?forum=tabletandtouch&prof=required)
